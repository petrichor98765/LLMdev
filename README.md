# LLMdev
Following along tutorials explaining my understanding of LLM's. 

In this repo, I intend to document my understandings and various models of LLM's.
My objectives are:
 - Use openAI
 - Use Google Gemini
 - Make an LLM from scratch

Some other goals I have in mind are:
 - Cloning CHat-GPT UI; Adding custom personas using any LLM
 - Having a conversation with documents
 - Using agents
 - Enabling LLMS to web browse
 - GPT research retrieval and QnA using Arxiv
 - Enabling LLMs to use 5+ tools in the real world
 - Equipping LLM's with our own custom tools
